Food Delivery SQL Insights Report

Project Overview:
This analysis explores food delivery trends, delivery efficiency, customer behavior, and geographic demand patterns using advanced SQL.

---

1. Delivery Efficiency
Metric: Avg delivery time per restaurant  
Insight:  
- Pizza Palace has an avg delivery time of 15 mins  
- Sushi Spot takes ~25 mins, suggesting longer prep or farther reach

4. Customer Retention

5. Regional Demand
Metric: Order count by region per week

- The Central region showed consistent weekly spikes  
- Promotions or dense population likely influence this trend

Next Steps:
- Combine SQL views with Tableau or Power BI dashboards  
- Expand schema with promotions, reviews, and delivery issues  
- Forecast delivery demand using time series modeling (future work)
